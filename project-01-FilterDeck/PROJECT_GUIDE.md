# **SearchBar Component** 🚀  

A **React-based** search feature that fetches user data from an API and allows searching by username. This project demonstrates **state management, API integration, controlled components, and array filtering in JavaScript**.  

## **📚 What I Learned**  
While building this project, I gained hands-on experience in:  
✔ **React Hooks:** `useState` for managing local state and `useEffect` for API calls.  
✔ **Fetching Data:** Using `fetch()` to retrieve and display data dynamically.  
✔ **Handling Input Fields:** Implementing **controlled components** for real-time updates.  
✔ **Efficient Filtering:** Leveraging `.includes()` and `.startsWith()` for search optimization.  
✔ **Component Reusability:** Utilizing the `UserCard` component for clean, modular code.  
✔ **Performance Optimization:** Avoiding unnecessary re-renders by maintaining separate state variables.
